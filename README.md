Implementation Technique:
Although the game can be easily implemnted by the common Data Structure "Linked Lists", but the coding time and excution time would take a long time as the elements are not stored contiguously like arrays. Therefore, it is more reasonable to implement such game with two dimensional arrays.

Time Complexity: All operations in the code are very time efficient and of O(1).

Important Note: To get the full advantage of the code (such as error messages printing), you should move it to a desktop compliler like "codeblocks". It will work on online compilers but not with its full power.
