Implementation Technique:
Although the game can be easily implemnted by the common Data Structure "Linked Lists", but the coding time and excution time would take a long time as the elements are not stored contiguously like arrays. Therefore, it is more reasonable to implement such game with two dimensional arrays.

Time Complexity: All operations in the code are very time efficient and of O(1).

Game Description:It is the Normal X-O game but with 9 boards. In order to win, you have to complete 3 boards as rows or as columns or as diagonals.
Rules: You will first choose a board and a cell to start with, the cell you play at is the same number of the board the next player will play at and the
cell that he chooses will be the board  will play at etc.
It has two modes of playing, 1)Against the computer or 2)Against A friend.
